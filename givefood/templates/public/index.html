      <h1>Give Food</h1>

      <p>We're a UK organisation that delivers food to foodbanks - using technology to supply, in bulk, the food required in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>We've delivered {{ total_weight|floatformat:1 }} tonnes of food, consisting of {{ total_items|intcomma }} items, and {{ total_calories|floatformat:1 }} million calories to {{ no_foodbanks }} foodbanks around the country.</p>

      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>We automatically monitor foodbank shopping lists and social media to identify what food is needed where. Then we have the food that's required delivered at a time and location convenient for easiest distribution.</p>
      <p>Where possible we notify foodbanks of an upcoming delivery, allowing them to plan - and then get feedback on the service afterwards.</p>

      <h2>What we deliver</h2>
      <p>We find that items like baked beans, tinned spaghetti and dried pasta are often well provisioned at foodbanks already.</p>
      <p>As such, we focus on delivering tinned and heavy food like tomatoes, vegetables, meat, fruit, custard, and rice pudding plus UHT milk. Occasionally we'll also supply hygiene products like shower gel, deodorant and shampoo.</p>

      <h2>Where we deliver</h2>
      <p>We currently deliver to {{ no_foodbanks }} foodbanks around the United Kingdom of varying sizes. Some are members of networks and some are independent.</p>
