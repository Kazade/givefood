      <p>We're a UK charity that delivers food &amp; supplies to food banks - using technology to supply, in bulk, what's required in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>We've delivered {{ total_weight|floatformat:2 }} tonnes of food, consisting of {{ total_items|intcomma }} items and {{ total_calories|floatformat:2 }} million calories, to {{ no_active_foodbanks }} food banks around the country.</p>
      <p>Whilst we believe that food banks should not exist in our country, we aim to help local organisations address the immediate and critical need created by food insecurity.</p>
      <p>We operate independent of religion and are privately funded by the Cartwright family.</p>

      <h2>What we deliver</h2>
      <p>We find that items like baked beans, tinned spaghetti and dried pasta are often well provisioned at food banks already.</p>
      <p>As such, we focus on delivering tinned and heavy food like tomatoes, vegetables, meat, fish, fruit, custard, and rice pudding plus UHT milk. Occasionally we'll also supply hygiene products like shower gel, deodorant and shampoo.</p>
      <p>We only deliver items that are requested, and suitable for storage on a shelf for extended periods.</p>

      <h2>Where we deliver</h2>
      <p>We currently supply {{ no_active_foodbanks }} food banks across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland of varying sizes. Some are members of networks and some are independent.</p>
