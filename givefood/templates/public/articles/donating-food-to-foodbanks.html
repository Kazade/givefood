        <h1>How to donate food to a food bank</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Foodbank usage in the UK has increased in the past few years — with benefit changes, problems with benefit systems, low income and debt being the main causes.</p>

        <p>Specifically, difficulties caused by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/23/million-families-cut-universal-credit-benefits-debts">Universal Credit</a> have been a major factor.</p>
        <p>Objectively, it’s pretty ridiculous that foodbanks even have to exist in a first-world country as hilariously rich as the UK. But I’m not going force my political views on you here — rather I’d like to show that people need food and the direct action that can help.</p>
        <p>So, what to do, aside from political action?</p>
        <p>Give money, give food or give labour. In this post I’m going to be focused on giving food.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can hand over your money here (or search for your local foodbank).</li>
          <li>Find details of volunteering here (or, again, search for your local foodbank).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What food is given to those in need?</h2>
        <p>The Trussell Trust has a standardised food parcel that aims to cover the nutritional needs of an adult for three days.</p>
        <p>These parcels feature a nutritionally balanced set of food and occasionally non-food items like toiletries.</p>
        <p>An extremely impressively in-depth report on food parcel nutritional make up was created by University College London, and is published at <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/Food_Parcel_Report_April_2018.pdf">https://www.trusselltrust.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/Food_Parcel_Report_April_2018.pdf</a> (PDF, 507KB)</p>
        <p>The key is that donated food is non-perishable, as foodbanks generally don’t have a fridge or freezer and a bulk order of food may sit on a shelf for up to a couple of weeks.</p>

        <h2>What to donate?</h2>
        <h3>Non-perishable food</h3>
        <p>Generally any donations of non-perishable food is good — if you want to make a food donation with little hassle this is the way to do it.</p>
        <p>Here’s some suggested items, in descending order of what I’ve seen to be useful...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tinned meat (pies, stews, curries, processed meat, fish)</li>
          <li>Tinned vegetables (beans, sweetcorn, potatoes, carrots, peas)</li>
          <li>Tinned tomatoes (chopped, whole, pasta sauces)</li>
          <li>UHT Milk</li>
          <li>Soup (vegetable, chicken, tomato, fish)</li>
          <li>Tinned/packaged desserts (fruit, custard, sponge puddings)</li>
          <li>Dried noodles &amp; pasta</li>
          <li>Spreads (peanut butter, jam, marmalade)</li>
          <li>Cereal &amp; oats</li>
          <li>Biscuits</li>
          <li>Tea &amp; coffee</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Perishable food</h3>
        <p>Perishable items are generally bought by foodbanks on demand and on the day, or donated by local businesses like a greengrocers or bakery.</p>
        <p>However, they can also be bought by a donor but, again, you have to be careful to make sure it’ll last at least three or more days without refrigeration.</p>
        <p>You should definately check with the individual foodbank before delivering to see if they can utilise the items like root vegetables (e.g. potatoes, carrots, swede, parsnips etc) or bread.</p>

        <h3>Non-food</h3>
        <p>Some foodbanks also give out non-food items to help people in crisis maintain their dignity. You should however check before potentially lumbering an organisation with items they are unable to give out.</p>
        <p>Suggested non-food donations...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tampons &amp; sanitary pads</li>
          <li>Razors &amp; shaving gel</li>
          <li>Deodorant</li>
          <li>Shower gel</li>
          <li>Toothbrushes &amp; toothpaste</li>
          <li>Baby supplies (wipes, nappies)</li>
          <li>Other household items (toilet roll, handwash, laundry detergent, washing-up liquid)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other considerations</h2>
        <p>Foodbanks in religiously diverse areas of the country often prefer to receive meat products that don’t contain pork.</p>
        <p>A common thread in foodbanks I’ve visited is that they don’t get enough meat products donated in general — presumably because of the higher per-item cost over other donations such as baked beans & pasta.</p>
        <p>School holidays are a big problem for people unable to afford food as the usual free school meals their children receive aren’t available. Some food banks, and Salvation Army outlets, require donations of items suitable for giving out as replacements for school lunches.</p>
        <p>To volunteer at a foodbank you’ll need to be DBS checked, and obviously if visiting you should be very respectful of the confidentiality of the other people there.</p>


        <h2>Logistics</h2>
        <p>Foodbanks often accept donations at drop off points in supermarkets.</p>
        <p>However, internet supermarket shopping has made it cheap and easy to get exactly what’s required delivered directly to the location where it’s sorted and distributed to those in need.</p>
        <p>Here’s the drill. You can go do this right now.</p>
        <p>Foodbanks often publish lists of what items they need on their websites or Facebook pages. They also publish the time and location where they accept donations.</p>
        <p>Putting the donation location address in an online supermarket will then allow you to book a slot at the day and hour food donations are accepted. Then it’s just a case of ordering what the location needs up to the minimum order level of the supermarket and paying.</p>

        <h2>Maximise your donation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use loyalty cards for discounts.</li>
          <li>Supermarket own-brand items offer just as good food for often much, much less money.</li>
          <li>Multi-buy deals work great for this. You might not use the many tins of something required to get a lower price, but a foodbank certainly will. Don’t be afraid that you’ll over-order something that’s needed.</li>
          <li>Don’t buy items packed in bulk unless they can be divvied up by the foodbank without opening the container. Food is given to recipient to cover three days.</li>
          <li>Be clever with item sizes. A 400g tin of food probably will be cheaper per calorie and therefore a better buy than a 200g one. But, as above, you probably don’t want to buy, say, the single 1kg item as it’s unsuitable for distribution in a food parcel.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trouble-free delivery</h2>
        <p>Pick the cheaper delivery slots, or use a scheme like Tesco’s Delivery Saver.</p>
        <p>If possible pick a delivery slot earlier rather than later in the foodbank’s opening hours. That’ll allow time for sorting the donation and possibly handing out in a parcel the same day.</p>
        <p>Use the online store’s delivery instructions text box to let the delivery driver know the order is for the foodbank. Also include the foodbank’s phone number, if possible. Saying ‘thank you’ in this box is recommended too!</p>
