     <h2>API</h2>
      <p><span class="tag is-danger">Alpha - don't actually use this</span></p>
      <p>We maintain the largest public database of UK food banks, and the donations of items they are requesting.</p>
      <p>This service allows to to get access to this data over HTTPS in JSON, XML or YAML.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Do good</em> with the data</li>
        <li>Try not to make requests more than a few times a second</li>
        <li>If you display a food bank and their need also use their URL to link to them. This will help the user get them what they request</li>
        <li>Credit us with a link to our homepage if you republish</li>
        <li>Cache, but don't cache for too long. All this is updated at least every few hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our API and data has been used by governments, supermarkets, The Times, Reach PLC, Cuvva, Munch &amp; Trussell Trust.</p>
      <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:mail@givefood.org.uk">mail@givefood.org.uk</a> if you're going to launch something using our data. We'll be more than happy to help with any technical questions &amp; optimisations, PR and to ensure that we're all helping food banks as effectively as possible.</p>
